Description
-----------

This repository contains a script to fetch various open source OpenType fonts
with a MATH table as well as the corresponding fonts to use for the surrounding
text (if any). The fonts are converted into WOFF format
using [sfnt2woff](https://people.mozilla.org/~jkew/woff/woff-code-latest.zip)
and are
[packaged](https://github.com/fred-wang/MathFonts/archive/gh-pages.zip) with
some documentation, a license and a `mathfont.css` stylesheet, so that you can
easily use them on your Web site. For completeness, some proprietary math fonts
are also listed but for obvious legal reasons they can not be provided
here.

Warning
-------

Note that only Gecko and WebKit have (more or less complete) support for the
OpenType MATH table. It is recommended to try the most recent versions.

The following open source fonts are not included yet:
- The DejaVu fonts have a MATH table, but the support is very limited.
- The Neo Euler font is still in development and has not been released yet.
- The development version of GNU Free fonts contains an OpenType MATH table
  but this is not available in the release yet.
- The STIX font is known to have many bugs that have been reported to the
  STIX consortium. [STIX 2.0.0 has been announced for early 2015](http://www.stixfonts.org/) but in the meantime you might want to use the XITS fork instead.

Also some (but not all) of the fonts provide old style numbers and calligraphic
letters accessible via OpenType font features. Some CSS rules from the
[CSS Fonts Module Level](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/)
are provided to help selecting the corresponding glyphs, but these are not
implemented/enabled in all browsers yet.

Using Math fonts on your Web site
---------------------------------

Clone the gh-pages branch with `git` or download the
[zip archive](https://github.com/fred-wang/MathFonts/archive/gh-pages.zip). Choose
one family for your web site and place the corresponding subdirectory somewhere.
Make your pages link to the `mathfonts.css` stylesheet. The MathML formulas
will then render with the specified font. It's good to make them consistent
with the surrounding text, especially for inline expressions. To do that,
use the `htmlmathparagraph` class, e.g. `<body class="htmlmathparagraph">`.
By default, the local fonts installed on the system will be used and otherwise
WOFF Web fonts will be used as a fallback (for open source fonts only).

Most families provide old style numbers in the text font. You can use them via
the `oldstylenumbers` class, e.g.
`<span class="oldstylenumbers">0123456789</span>`. Some of the math fonts also
provide calligraphic style for the script characters, that you can select
with the `calligraphic` class e.g.
`<math><mi mathvariant="script" class="calligraphic">A</mi></math>` or
equivalently `<math><mi class="calligraphic">ùíú</mi></math>`.

Build Instructions
------------------

You need [GNU Core Utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities)
(or equivalent on UNIX systems) as well as `sed`, `grep`, `unzip`, `wget` and
[sfnt2woff](https://people.mozilla.org/~jkew/woff/woff-code-latest.zip). Type
the following command to build the font directories:

    ./configure
    make

Use `make clean` to remove intermediary files and `make distclean` to remove
all the files that are not tracked on GitHub.
